About pyMonitorix
=================
pyMonitorix is an applet application that acts as a fronted of the Monitorix
application installed on a local or remote server(s). It is useful for those

browser for doing that.


Requirements
============

Though pyMonitorix has only been tested on Linux, it should run on other
UNIX-like Operating Systems without modification (feedback would be
appreciated).

GNOME, Python and PyGTK are available pre-packaged with most Linux distributions
. Alternatively they may be obtained from the following sites:

  http://www.gnome.org/
