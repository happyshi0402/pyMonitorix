To translate pyMonitorix into a different language
==================================================

1) Copy pymonitorix.pot to <LOCALE>.po.
	i.e: de.po
2) Edit <LOCALE>.po file inserting the translations of the 'msgid' lines into
   the 'msgstr' lines, just below them.
3) Save it when you're done.

Submit your translation for inclusion in the next pyMonitorix release.
Email your <LOCALE>.po file to me: jordi@fibranet.cat.

Thanks for your contribution.
